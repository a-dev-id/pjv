                        After nearly a year of scrolling through countless of Instagram-worthy resorts in Bali, one property lived inside my head for a while, after stumbling upon it once on a friend’s feed. So when I finally got to the “Island of Gods”, I made sure I wasn’t going to miss it. Enter, Hanging Gardens of Bali – featuring one of the world’s most spectacular pools, which juts over a lush ravine – is an Ubud hotel legend, popular with travelers who thrive on aesthetics.

                        I began my journey the day I graduated from The Culinary Academy of Bandung. Shortly after, I started my first job in Dubai. From the Middle East, I had the opportunity to relocate to the USA and train with some of the best people in the culinary world. From America, I came back to Indonesia to re-season myself in the arts and science of Indonesian cooking. That passion paired with my experiences in various luxury hotels, I finally landed in Hanging Gardens International, which I am proud to call my home.

                        Bali is renowned for many things: its climate, its stunning scenery, its variety of luxurious villas and hotels and its popularity as a top wedding or honeymoon destination. But did you know that the cuisine in Bali is amongst the most varied in the World? The climate here has allowed for the development of some very unusual fruits, many of which we grow ourselves in our own organic herbal garden.

                        We include lots of these tasty fruits in the deliciously fresh cocktails available at the Hanging Gardens of Bali’s very own Garden Bar.

                        The award winning luxury resort Hanging Gardens of Bali, hidden deep in a steep jungle valley north of the spiritual center of Ubud, is situated next to a traditional Balinese village. Susut village, itself is home to families who still live the authentic Balinese life style.

                        Susut village still keeps its traditional way of life and activities such as rice farming, growing fruits and pig breeding. And it is considered a very small hamlet, yet it is one of the most stunning and authentic living places in Bali.

                        The architectural uniqueness of Hanging Gardens of Bali baffles architects and developers to such an extent that they are in explicitly drawn to explore the wonders and see for themselves. The structural complexity of the hotel is unparalleled because of the impossible topography and the engineering solutions that the designers of the hotel had to put into play when dealing with the difficult terrain. In fact all building materials had to be carried by hand as there was no accessibility for vehicles at the time. A stable structure had to be designed and built to accommodate the 41 infinity pools literally hanging over the jungle valley with ground breaking and innovative feats of engineering.

                        Rather than at glamorous parties however, this traditional drink was enjoyed during a ritual of ‘Afternoon Tea’. Back then, this occasion was only reserved for the most privileged of citizens – and guests at the Hanging Gardens of Bali can also experience some of this fine exclusivity themselves with our afternoon tea package on offer, right in the heart of the jungle at Ubud.

                        But before you take part in this sophisticated past-time, let us tell you some more about the origins of “Afternoon tea”.
